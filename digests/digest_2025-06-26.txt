**Windies bowl Australia out for 180 on chaotic first day**
Australia were skittled out for just 180 against West Indies - but hit back with the ball as 14 wickets fell on a chaotic opening day of the first Test in Bridgetown.

Seamers Jayden Seales and Shamar Joseph shared nine wickets as Australia were dismissed in less than 57 overs after winning the toss.

Travis Head top-scored with 59 and opener Usman Khawaja hit 47, but captain Pat Cummins (28) and Beau Webster (11) were the only other batters to reach double figures.

The tourists clawed their way back into the match when their experienced pace trio of Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Cummins combined to reduce West Indies to 57-4 at close.

"That was pretty special," said Seales, who took five wickets and added that their plans had worked out well.

"Shamar [Joseph] was special. He has a love for Australia. He got through the top order and made it easy for us in the middle and at the end.

"We knew the batters would come hard if we gave them width, and the plan was to bowl full and as much at the stumps as possible.

"[It was] a little slower than what the Australians would have expected, and that made them play a lot more."

**Elliott is England U21s 'man for the moment' amid uncertain club future**
With just five minutes to go, Harvey Elliott stood and savoured the acclaim.

The Liverpool player raised his arms at the Stadion Tehelne pole in celebration, drinking in the reception after scoring his - and England Under-21s' - second goal - one which ultimately sent the Young Lions into their second successive Euro final.

Elliott's double booked a showdown with Germany on Saturday as Lee Carsley's defending champions deservedly beat the Netherlands in the sweltering heat of Bratislava.

A pocket of young fans had spent the majority of the second half chanting Elliott's name, especially after he smashed in a fine 62nd-minute opener, and he deserved the adulation after a season of frustration.

He did, though, admit he would need to re-think the sliding celebration that came after his opener.

"I decided to a do a silly knee slide which really hurt, but you have to live in the moment," Elliott told BBC Radio 5 Live.

"You do these things, but I forgot the pitch was ridiculously dry and it is the price I have got to pay. There's nothing better than scoring for your country in front of your family in the stands.

"We all deserve to be here, the squad is incredible in terms of the quality, in terms of how we play football as a team and the togetherness we have.

"The moment we have fear within ourselves is the moment it goes wrong. We can take on any team."

**Sheehan to captain British and Irish Lions against Western Force**
Ireland's Dan Sheehan will captain the British and Irish Lions in their opening game on Australian soil against the Western Force on Saturday.

The hooker is one of five players in the starting line-up who will make their Lions debut in Perth, his Leinster team-mates Garry Ringrose, James Lowe, Joe McCarthy and Josh van der Flier being the others.

Four more Lions are set to make their debut off the bench - lock Ollie Chessum, centre Huw Jones, and props Andrew Porter and Will Stuart.

Northampton tyro Henry Pollock will make his first start at number eight having come off the bench against Argentina last Friday night.

Head coach Andy Farrell is still without scrum-half Jamison Gibson-Park and Hugo Keenan, both inching their way back from injury, so Elliot Daly is in at full-back and Tomos Williams is rewarded for a fine cameo against the Pumas in Dublin with a start in the nine jersey.

Finn Russell, who made three appearances on the tour of South Africa in 2021, will start at fly-half.

Farrell goes with a new midfield combination in Ringrose and Scotland's Sione Tuipulotu, who will make successive starts.

Tuipulotu and Tadhg Beirne are the only two players selected to start against Argentina and the Force, albeit both have moved position, the Scot from outside to inside centre and the Irishman from lock to blindside flanker.

How the researchers hope to create human DNA

Work has begun on a controversial project to create the building blocks of human life from scratch, in what is believed to be a world first. Details of the project were given to BBC News on the 25th anniversary of the completion of the Human Genome Project, which mapped the molecules in human DNA and was also largely funded by Wellcome.

Every cell in our body contains a molecule called DNA which carries the genetic information it needs. "Building DNA from scratch allows us to test out how DNA really works and test out new theories, because currently we can only really do that by tweaking DNA in DNA that already exists in living systems".

Ticket touts are employing teams of workers to bulk-buy tickets for the UK's biggest concerts like Oasis and Taylor Swift so they can be resold for profit, a BBC investigation has found. Since 1994 it has been a criminal offence to resell tickets for football matches in the UK unless authorised, with the maximum penalty being a £1,000 fine.

But we found 8,000 tickets being advertised illegally online for more than face value for Arsenal's Premier League game with Chelsea at the Emirates Stadium on 16 March.

The big loser of the night wasn't his main opponent, former governor Andrew Cuomo, he said, but the US Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who represents the Democratic Party establishment.

Grassroots Democrats are demanding "a more ideological, confrontational approach to policy and politics" in the time of US President Donald Trump, Mr Luntz said.

Before Tuesday night's win, Cuomo and several Democrats mocked Mamdani's platform - including free public buses and city-run grocery shops - as unrealistic. "It was really inspiring."

**Andy Murray: I'm trying to keep my kids off 'damaging' social media**
"Athletes across all sports have been discussing this for a long time, but it hasn't really changed. Me and my wife are trying to keep our children off social media until they are much older, because I think it can be pretty damaging."

Murray's eldest child is nine, while his youngest is four. It is being introduced in phases and social media platforms are now obliged to protect users from illegal or harmful content, while more child safety measures are being introduced next month.

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC the government will also explore whether further protective measures can be put in place on social media platforms.

Figures provided by data science firm Signify, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and Women's Tennis Association (WTA) show that in 2024, about 8,000 abusive, violent or threatening messages were sent publicly to 458 tennis players through their social media accounts.

Following Boulter's comments, fellow tennis players demanded more action, including calls for the introduction of identity verification.

Several of the England women's football team also plan to give up social media for their forthcoming European Championship defence in Switzerland.

Murray said: "I don't know whose responsibility it is, I don't know if the government needs to do more to tackle it, or [X owner] Elon Musk and people like that can do more to stop these messages getting through to individuals.

"I don't mean just athletes, but then you get into the whole debate around free speech and it's a difficult one."

Murray also said athletes could help themselves "by trying to avoid looking at the comments and going on our phones immediately after matches", but the onus was not on them to solve the problem.

Former British tennis player Naomi Broady, 35, told BBC Radio 5 Live about her experiences of abuse on social media, saying: "I've seen the worst of trolling and after I had children, I don't show their faces any more."

**'A sensible signing' - Arsenal agree Norgaard deal**
Arsenal have agreed a deal with Brentford to sign midfielder Christian Norgaard.

Sources have indicated the Gunners have been discussing a fee worth in the region of an initial £10m, with a possible £5m in performance-related add-ons.

The move for Norgaard comes just a week before Thomas Partey's Arsenal contract expires.

Ghana international Partey, 32, has been in talks over a new deal to stay at Emirates Stadium, but no agreement has been reached.

BBC Sport understands Sevilla's French midfielder Lucien Agoume, 23, also featured prominently on Arsenal's list of potential targets to replace Partey.

Crucially, however, it is understood manager Mikel Arteta identified Norgaard as the midfielder he wanted because he preferred a Premier League-ready player.

Club-to-club discussions over the Denmark international have accelerated in the last 24 hours and a deal is now in place.

The 31-year-old, who joined Brentford from Fiorentina in 2019, will now undergo a medical before completing his move.

**Elliott is England U21s 'man for the moment' amid uncertain club future**
With just five minutes to go, Harvey Elliott stood and savoured the acclaim.

The Liverpool player raised his arms at the Stadion Tehelne pole in celebration, drinking in the reception after scoring his - and England Under-21s' - second goal - one which ultimately sent the Young Lions into their second successive Euro final.

Elliott's double booked a showdown with Germany on Saturday as Lee Carsley's defending champions deservedly beat the Netherlands in the sweltering heat of Bratislava.

A pocket of young fans had spent the majority of the second half chanting Elliott's name, especially after he smashed in a fine 62nd-minute opener, and he deserved the adulation after a season of frustration.

He did, though, admit he would need to re-think the sliding celebration that came after his opener.

"I decided to a do a silly knee slide which really hurt, but you have to live in the moment," Elliott told BBC Radio 5 Live.

"You do these things, but I forgot the pitch was ridiculously dry and it is the price I have got to pay. There's nothing better than scoring for your country in front of your family in the stands.

"We all deserve to be here, the squad is incredible in terms of the quality, in terms of how we play football as a team and the togetherness we have.

"The moment we have fear within ourselves is the moment it goes wrong. We can take on any team."

**Temperatures above 30C expected as a second June heatwave looms**
The second heatwave of 2025 is set to send temperatures soaring back over the 30C mark this weekend.

The hot weather will last into the first part of next week with the heat becoming increasingly intense with the possibility of recording the highest temperature of the year so far.

The hottest day of 2025 to date was recorded on 21 June at Charlwood, Surrey with temperatures reaching 33.2C (91.8F).

Heatwaves are becoming more common due to climate change, with a greater chance of seeing extreme heat.

There are lots of summer events that will be affected by the heat. It's likely to be the hottest start to Wimbledon, surpassing the record of 29.3C (measured at Kew) from 2001. Temperatures will get close to the Glastonbury record of 31.2C (measured at Rodney Stoke) recorded in 2017.

**UK firms to be protected from cheap imports**
UK firms to be protected from cheap imports

But Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the UK's plan would "ensure British businesses are protected from harm".

Some sectors are concerned that cars and steel originally destined for US markets will be diverted onto UK shores, as President Donald Trump's tariffs make it significantly more expensive to sell in America.

It aims to remove obstacles for UK businesses selling abroad while also bolstering the country's trade defences to avoid the threat of cheap imports undercutting domestic companies.

The government is to unveil a new plan for trade aimed at boosting exports and protecting UK firms at a time of growing uncertainty for businesses following the introduction of US tariffs.

The plan will be announced during the annual British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) conference in London on Thursday.

A unilateral trade strategy could be difficult to achieve – it is a game of international give and take and the plan is more about sharpening offence and defence.

One offence strategy outlined is that there will be more government financial backing for exporters, and help understanding complex trade rules.

But the key part for many is defence, in particular for industries such as steel and cars.

Unlike the EU, the UK has not imposed high tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles and current safeguards against cheap steel imports are due to expire in 2026.

An influx of Chinese made cars would make it difficult for UK sellers to compete.

At the conference, the government is expected to announce increased focus on boosting the UK's export of services, and point to recent successes in signing a free trade agreement with India after years of wrangling.

It will also point to closer trading ties with the EU and being the first country to secure better terms with the Trump White House on tariffs. He argues that America has been taken advantage of by "cheaters" and "pillaged" by foreigners.

However, Andrew Opie of the British Retail Consortium, which represents retailers, said that though the UK's trade deals were good, the bigger win for consumers would be "swift action" by the chancellor on abuse of the "de minimis" rule, which allow low-value packages to enter the UK tax-free.

Use of such rules has surged in the past decade. Intended for consumers buying goods for personal use from abroad, some businesses have used it to avoid paying tax on their goods.

There has been criticism they have given overseas firms such as Shein and Temu an unfair advantage over British businesses.

**The Papers: Starmer 'in denial' and 'from Russia with shove'**
Starmer 'in denial' and 'from Russia with shove'

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is "in denial" about the scale of Labour MPs' welfare rebellion writes the Guardian. In an exclusive for the paper, it also carries an interview with Leon Panetta, the former head of the CIA. It has been criticised by unionist and nationalist parties in Northern Ireland, and Labour has committed to repealing it.

The Express leads on a story about a group of nurses in Darlington challenging their health trust's policy over allowing a trans colleague to use the female changing rooms at work.

The potential backbench rebellion over the government's proposed changes to welfare is the main news in the Times, which says "Rebel MPs want regime change".

The paper says some Labour MPs and ministers see changes to Sir Keir Starmer's inner team, described as "over-excitable boys", as the price for securing their backing for the government's plans.

The Guardian says the prime minister is "in denial" about the scale of the problem on his hands in next Tuesday's vote.

According to the i Paper, concessions to the likely rebels are being worked out inside Downing Street.

The Daily Express reports the prime minister's insistence that the row will not drive him from Number 10.

Analysis in the Daily Telegraph shows the capacity for the row to have an impact at the next general election.

Fifty-one of the MPs considered likely to vote against the existing government plans have majorities which are smaller than the number of Pip claimants in their constituency.

The paper reports that the arithmetic may make it impossible for the Downing Street to convince dozens of rebels to support its plans, under any circumstances.

"Stop Labour's betrayal of our SAS heroes" is the front page headline in the Daily Mail.

The paper wants ministers to U-turn on their pledge to repeal the previous government's Legacy Act, which protects some Northern Ireland veterans from historical prosecution.

The Sun claims Russia is providing fake documents, transport and military escorts to people-smugglers who co-ordinate Channel crossings.

A security source has told the paper president Vladimir Putin sees the issue as an opportunity to "cause disruption and destabilise".

The way the Nato chief, Mark Rutte dealt with President Trump at the summit in the Hague attracts much attention.

The Daily Mirror describes his decision to call Trump "the daddy" as "toe-curling", "bizarre" and "cringe".

The Times labels Rutte the "Trump-whisperer", while the Guardian calls their relationship a "budding bromance".

The Daily Star claims a showbiz exclusive with a shock front page report that the BBC is ending its popular Sunday night series, Call the Midwife.

It says the programme is to end after one more series, the 15th, and what it calls a "blockbuster" movie.

**Andy Murray wants to shield kids from 'damaging' social media**
"Athletes across all sports have been discussing this for a long time, but it hasn't really changed. Me and my wife are trying to keep our children off social media until they are much older, because I think it can be pretty damaging."

Murray's eldest child is nine, while his youngest is four. It is being introduced in phases and social media platforms are now obliged to protect users from illegal or harmful content, while more child safety measures are being introduced next month.

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC the government will also explore whether further protective measures can be put in place on social media platforms.

Figures provided by data science firm Signify, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and Women's Tennis Association (WTA) show that in 2024, about 8,000 abusive, violent or threatening messages were sent publicly to 458 tennis players through their social media accounts.

Following Boulter's comments, fellow tennis players demanded more action, including calls for the introduction of identity verification.

Several of the England women's football team also plan to give up social media for their forthcoming European Championship defence in Switzerland.

Murray said: "I don't know whose responsibility it is, I don't know if the government needs to do more to tackle it, or [X owner] Elon Musk and people like that can do more to stop these messages getting through to individuals.

"I don't mean just athletes, but then you get into the whole debate around free speech and it's a difficult one."

Murray also said athletes could help themselves "by trying to avoid looking at the comments and going on our phones immediately after matches", but the onus was not on them to solve the problem.

**Sir Gareth joins the greats as football's seventh knighted manager**
On the list of football manager knights, only Winterbottom and Southgate have not won a trophy in their managerial career.

Southgate fell short of being the winner England and the Football Association wanted as they tried to end a barren sequence for the men's senior team stretching back to the 1966 World Cup triumph.

But along the way, Southgate did much to restore the image of his squad and the game.

England lost successive European Championship finals, to Spain in 2024 and to Italy at Wembley in 2021.

They were also beaten in a World Cup semi-final by Croatia in Moscow in 2018, meaning Southgate's reign will ultimately be judged as that of a nearly manager of a nearly team.

This may be regarded as a harsh judgement, but reality shows that Southgate could not overcome the obstacles to that elusive England success with a richly talented squad, as well as in circumstances that favoured them, such as against Italy in a home final.

Legacies can be built on the finest of margins, and this was Southgate's.

In the wider context, however, that record stands comparison to – and indeed improves upon – that of any of his predecessors following Sir Alf's World Cup win.

The knighthood accolade is reward for the exemplary manner in which he served England and the Football Association on so many levels: as a distinguished full international, coach of the under-21s, then as senior team manager when he succeeded Sam Allardyce, who left after one game, in late 2016.

He inherited chaos and almost turned it into silver.

When measured in honours, Southgate's career may not be able to stand alongside those other names who claimed the game's biggest prizes - as a player he won the League Cup with Aston Villa in 1996 and again when he captained Middlesbrough in 2004 - but his significance and influence in the recent era is unquestionable.
