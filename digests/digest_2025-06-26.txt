**The Commonwealth Games swimmer who might not see 40**
A year ago, a poolside phone call changed Archie Goodburn's life.

The Scottish 50m breaststroke record holder was dreaming of the Paris Olympics but his training had been hindered by some unusual factors.

Seizures. He called back. They are inoperable and unable to be removed given how they had spread through his brain.

"It was utter shock," says Goodburn, who reached the semi-finals of the 50m and the 100m breaststroke at the 2022 Commonwealth Games.

"Going from a healthy, young person to suddenly being told you have this ticking time-bomb in your brain that could, from one day to the next, become significantly worse and that there's nothing we can do to stop it."

**Windies bowl Australia out for 180 on chaotic first day**
Australia were skittled out for just 180 against West Indies - but hit back with the ball as 14 wickets fell on a chaotic opening day of the first Test in Bridgetown.

Seamers Jayden Seales and Shamar Joseph shared nine wickets as Australia were dismissed in less than 57 overs after winning the toss.

Travis Head top-scored with 59 and opener Usman Khawaja hit 47, but captain Pat Cummins (28) and Beau Webster (11) were the only other batters to reach double figures.

The tourists clawed their way back into the match when their experienced pace trio of Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Cummins combined to reduce West Indies to 57-4 at close.

Playing their first Test match in the Caribbean for 10 years, Australia named a new-look top order with Steve Smith injured and Marnus Labuschagne dropped following their World Test Championship defeat to South Africa.

**'A sensible signing' - Arsenal agree Norgaard deal**
Arsenal have agreed a deal with Brentford to sign midfielder Christian Norgaard.

Sources have indicated the Gunners have been discussing a fee worth in the region of an initial £10m, with a possible £5m in performance-related add-ons.

The move for Norgaard comes just a week before Thomas Partey's Arsenal contract expires.

Ghana international Partey, 32, has been in talks over a new deal to stay at Emirates Stadium, but no agreement has been reached.

BBC Sport understands Sevilla's French midfielder Lucien Agoume, 23, also featured prominently on Arsenal's list of potential targets to replace Partey.

Crucially, however, it is understood manager Mikel Arteta identified Norgaard as the midfielder he wanted because he preferred a Premier League-ready player.

Club-to-club discussions over the Denmark international have accelerated in the last 24 hours and a deal is now in place.

The 31-year-old, who joined Brentford from Fiorentina in 2019, will now undergo a medical before completing his move.

**Sir Gareth joins the greats as football's seventh knighted manager**
On the list of football manager knights, only Winterbottom and Southgate have not won a trophy in their managerial career.

Southgate fell short of being the winner England and the Football Association wanted as they tried to end a barren sequence for the men's senior team stretching back to the 1966 World Cup triumph.

But along the way, Southgate did much to restore the image of his squad and the game.

England lost successive European Championship finals, to Spain in 2024 and to Italy at Wembley in 2021.

They were also beaten in a World Cup semi-final by Croatia in Moscow in 2018, meaning Southgate's reign will ultimately be judged as that of a nearly manager of a nearly team.

This may be regarded as a harsh judgement, but reality shows that Southgate could not overcome the obstacles to that elusive England success with a richly talented squad, as well as in circumstances that favoured them, such as against Italy in a home final.

Legacies can be built on the finest of margins, and this was Southgate's.

In the wider context, however, that record stands comparison to – and indeed improves upon – that of any of his predecessors following Sir Alf's World Cup win.

The knighthood accolade is reward for the exemplary manner in which he served England and the Football Association on so many levels: as a distinguished full international, coach of the under-21s, then as senior team manager when he succeeded Sam Allardyce, who left after one game, in late 2016.

He inherited chaos and almost turned it into silver.

When measured in honours, Southgate's career may not be able to stand alongside those other names who claimed the game's biggest prizes - as a player he won the League Cup with Aston Villa in 1996 and again when he captained Middlesbrough in 2004 - but his significance and influence in the recent era is unquestionable.

**Raducanu must 'get head in the game' before Wimbledon**
Emma Raducanu says she needs to get her "head in the game" for the start of Wimbledon after defeat by teenager Maya Joint ended her difficult week in Eastbourne.

The 22-year-old lost 4-6 6-1 7-6 (7-4) to the Australian 19-year-old in an edgy second-round match.

Former US Open champion Raducanu rallied from 5-2 down in the deciding set to force a tie-break.

But the out-of-sorts Briton could not make it two comeback victories in as many days, having fought back from a set down in an emotional first-round win on the south coast.

"Unfortunately I couldn't get over the line today but I can get some rest ahead of next week," she said.

Wimbledon starts on Monday, 30 June, leaving Raducanu with a tight turnaround.

She said on Tuesday she had received "some really bad news" which knocked her mentally.

"I feel quite tired. Just going through some stuff and I need to do my best to get my head in the game ahead of next week," she said.

"Realistically, the turnaround is pretty soon - it's only four days away really that Wimbledon starts.

"I think I'm just going to start with [a day off] tomorrow and then hopefully I can get on the court on Friday."

**Elliott is England U21s 'man for the moment' amid uncertain club future**
With just five minutes to go, Harvey Elliott stood and savoured the acclaim.

The Liverpool player raised his arms at the Stadion Tehelne pole in celebration, drinking in the reception after scoring his - and England Under-21s' - second goal - one which ultimately sent the Young Lions into their second successive Euro final.

Elliott's double booked a showdown with Germany on Saturday as Lee Carsley's defending champions deservedly beat the Netherlands in the sweltering heat of Bratislava.

A pocket of young fans had spent the majority of the second half chanting Elliott's name, especially after he smashed in a fine 62nd-minute opener, and he deserved the adulation after a season of frustration.

He did, though, admit he would need to re-think the sliding celebration that came after his opener.

"I decided to a do a silly knee slide which really hurt, but you have to live in the moment," Elliott told BBC Radio 5 Live.

"You do these things, but I forgot the pitch was ridiculously dry and it is the price I have got to pay. There's nothing better than scoring for your country in front of your family in the stands.

"We all deserve to be here, the squad is incredible in terms of the quality, in terms of how we play football as a team and the togetherness we have.

"The moment we have fear within ourselves is the moment it goes wrong. We can take on any team."

**Murray wants to shield kids from 'damaging' social media**
"Athletes across all sports have been discussing this for a long time, but it hasn't really changed. Me and my wife are trying to keep our children off social media until they are much older, because I think it can be pretty damaging."

Murray's eldest child is nine, while his youngest is four. It is being introduced in phases and social media platforms are now obliged to protect users from illegal or harmful content, while more child safety measures are being introduced next month.

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC the government will also explore whether further protective measures can be put in place on social media platforms.

Figures provided by data science firm Signify, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and Women's Tennis Association (WTA) show that in 2024, about 8,000 abusive, violent or threatening messages were sent publicly to 458 tennis players through their social media accounts.

Following Boulter's comments, fellow tennis players demanded more action, including calls for the introduction of identity verification.

Several of the England women's football team also plan to give up social media for their forthcoming European Championship defence in Switzerland.

Murray said: "I don't know whose responsibility it is, I don't know if the government needs to do more to tackle it, or [X owner] Elon Musk and people like that can do more to stop these messages getting through to individuals.

"I don't mean just athletes, but then you get into the whole debate around free speech and it's a difficult one."

Murray also said athletes could help themselves "by trying to avoid looking at the comments and going on our phones immediately after matches", but the onus was not on them to solve the problem.

Former British tennis player Naomi Broady, 35, told BBC Radio 5 Live about her experiences of abuse on social media, saying: "I've seen the worst of trolling and after I had children, I don't show their faces any more."

**Temperatures above 30C expected as a second June heatwave looms**
The second heatwave of 2025 is set to send temperatures soaring back over the 30C mark this weekend.

The hot weather will last into the first part of next week with the heat becoming increasingly intense with the possibility of recording the highest temperature of the year so far.

The hottest day of 2025 to date was recorded on 21 June at Charlwood, Surrey with temperatures reaching 33.2C (91.8F).

Heatwaves are becoming more common due to climate change, with a greater chance of seeing extreme heat.

There are lots of summer events that will be affected by the heat. It's likely to be the hottest start to Wimbledon, surpassing the record of 29.3C (measured at Kew) from 2001. Temperatures will get close to the Glastonbury record of 31.2C (measured at Rodney Stoke) recorded in 2017.

**UK firms to be protected from cheap imports**
UK firms to be protected from cheap imports

But Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the UK's plan would "ensure British businesses are protected from harm".

Some sectors are concerned that cars and steel originally destined for US markets will be diverted onto UK shores, as President Donald Trump's tariffs make it significantly more expensive to sell in America.

It aims to remove obstacles for UK businesses selling abroad while also bolstering the country's trade defences to avoid the threat of cheap imports undercutting domestic companies.

The government is to unveil a new plan for trade aimed at boosting exports and protecting UK firms at a time of growing uncertainty for businesses following the introduction of US tariffs.

The plan will be announced during the annual British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) conference in London on Thursday.

A unilateral trade strategy could be difficult to achieve – it is a game of international give and take and the plan is more about sharpening offence and defence.

One offence strategy outlined is that there will be more government financial backing for exporters, and help understanding complex trade rules.

But the key part for many is defence, in particular for industries such as steel and cars.

Unlike the EU, the UK has not imposed high tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles and current safeguards against cheap steel imports are due to expire in 2026.

An influx of Chinese made cars would make it difficult for UK sellers to compete.

At the conference, the government is expected to announce increased focus on boosting the UK's export of services, and point to recent successes in signing a free trade agreement with India after years of wrangling.

It will also point to closer trading ties with the EU and being the first country to secure better terms with the Trump White House on tariffs. He argues that America has been taken advantage of by "cheaters" and "pillaged" by foreigners.

However, Andrew Opie of the British Retail Consortium, which represents retailers, said that though the UK's trade deals were good, the bigger win for consumers would be "swift action" by the chancellor on abuse of the "de minimis" rule, which allow low-value packages to enter the UK tax-free.

Use of such rules has surged in the past decade. Intended for consumers buying goods for personal use from abroad, some businesses have used it to avoid paying tax on their goods.

There has been criticism they have given overseas firms such as Shein and Temu an unfair advantage over British businesses.

**The Papers: Starmer 'in denial' and 'from Russia with shove'**
Starmer 'in denial' and 'from Russia with shove'

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is "in denial" about the scale of Labour MPs' welfare rebellion writes the Guardian. In an exclusive for the paper, it also carries an interview with Leon Panetta, the former head of the CIA. It has been criticised by unionist and nationalist parties in Northern Ireland, and Labour has committed to repealing it.

The Express leads on a story about a group of nurses in Darlington challenging their health trust's policy over allowing a trans colleague to use the female changing rooms at work.

The potential backbench rebellion over the government's proposed changes to welfare is the main news in the Times, which says "Rebel MPs want regime change".

The paper says some Labour MPs and ministers see changes to Sir Keir Starmer's inner team, described as "over-excitable boys", as the price for securing their backing for the government's plans.

The Guardian says the prime minister is "in denial" about the scale of the problem on his hands in next Tuesday's vote.

According to the i Paper, concessions to the likely rebels are being worked out inside Downing Street.

The Daily Express reports the prime minister's insistence that the row will not drive him from Number 10.

Analysis in the Daily Telegraph shows the capacity for the row to have an impact at the next general election.

Fifty-one of the MPs considered likely to vote against the existing government plans have majorities which are smaller than the number of Pip claimants in their constituency.

The paper reports that the arithmetic may make it impossible for the Downing Street to convince dozens of rebels to support its plans, under any circumstances.

"Stop Labour's betrayal of our SAS heroes" is the front page headline in the Daily Mail.

The paper wants ministers to U-turn on their pledge to repeal the previous government's Legacy Act, which protects some Northern Ireland veterans from historical prosecution.

The Sun claims Russia is providing fake documents, transport and military escorts to people-smugglers who co-ordinate Channel crossings.

A security source has told the paper president Vladimir Putin sees the issue as an opportunity to "cause disruption and destabilise".

The way the Nato chief, Mark Rutte dealt with President Trump at the summit in the Hague attracts much attention.

The Daily Mirror describes his decision to call Trump "the daddy" as "toe-curling", "bizarre" and "cringe".

The Times labels Rutte the "Trump-whisperer", while the Guardian calls their relationship a "budding bromance".

The Daily Star claims a showbiz exclusive with a shock front page report that the BBC is ending its popular Sunday night series, Call the Midwife.

It says the programme is to end after one more series, the 15th, and what it calls a "blockbuster" movie.

**Director of new James Bond film announced**
Director of new James Bond film announced

Villeneuve will also serve as executive producer of the new film and has received global acclaim for his recent take on the Dune franchise, along with hits such as Blade Runner 2049 and Arrival.

Speculation has been swirling over the future of the 007 films after long-time Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson stepped down from their roles in February.

In a statement released by the studio, Villeneuve says he is a "die-hard James Bond fan" and intends to "honor the tradition" of the franchise.

Denis Villeneuve, the Oscar nominated French-Canadian filmmaker, will direct the next James Bond film, Amazon MGM Studios has announced.

Amazon did not release details on the next actor to play James Bond in the announcement.

Villeneuve acknowledged the "massive responsibility" of helming the new film and expressed his excitement at the challenge.

"I grew up watching James Bond films with my father, ever since Dr No with Sean Connery. I'm a die-hard Bond fan. To me, he's sacred territory," he said.

"I intend to honour the tradition and open the path for many new missions to come."

He added that he and fellow producers Amy Pascal and David Heyman are "thrilled to bring him [Bond] back to the screen".

Head of Amazon MGM Studios Mike Hopkins hailed Villeneuve as a "cinematic master" and praised his ability to deliver "immersive storytelling" for global audiences.

"James Bond is in the hands of one of today's greatest filmmakers and we cannot wait to get started on 007's next adventure," he said.

Pascal and Heyman added it was always Villeneuve's dream to make a Bond film and "we are lucky to be in the hands of this extraordinary filmmaker".

It's still unclear when the next Bond film will be released as the search for the next actor to play the titular spy continues.

British actors Aaron Taylor-Johnson and James Norton have been rumoured as frontrunners, while Irish actor Paul Mescal's name has also been thrown into the mix.

Villeneuve gained prominence with a series of critical successes including Sicario, Prisoners and Incendies.

His 2016 science fiction thriller Arrival earned him his first Oscar nomination for directing.

Most recently, blockbusters Dune and Dune: Part Two grossed a combined total of more than $1bn (£730m) worldwide, with both films nominated for Best Picture Oscars in their respective years.

Villeneuve is expected to start shooting Dune Messiah, the third movie of the Dune franchise, later this year with a potential release date in 2026.

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC the government will also explore whether further protective measures can be put in place on social media platforms.

Figures provided by data science firm Signify, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and Women's Tennis Association (WTA) show that in 2024, about 8,000 abusive, violent or threatening messages were sent publicly to 458 tennis players through their social media accounts.

Following Boulter's comments, fellow tennis players demanded more action, including calls for the introduction of identity verification.

Several of the England women's football team also plan to give up social media for their forthcoming European Championship defence in Switzerland.

Murray said: "I don't know whose responsibility it is, I don't know if the government needs to do more to tackle it, or [X owner] Elon Musk and people like that can do more to stop these messages getting through to individuals.

"I don't mean just athletes, but then you get into the whole debate around free speech and it's a difficult one."

Murray also said athletes could help themselves "by trying to avoid looking at the comments and going on our phones immediately after matches", but the onus was not on them to solve the problem.

Former British tennis player Naomi Broady, 35, told BBC Radio 5 Live about her experiences of abuse on social media, saying: "I've seen the worst of trolling and after I had children, I don't show their faces any more."

Ticket touts are employing teams of workers to bulk-buy tickets for the UK's biggest concerts like Oasis and Taylor Swift so they can be resold for profit, a BBC investigation has found. "You're not allowing a lot of people to get access because you're hoarding the tickets."

A former Viagogo employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity, claims he had seen a vendor with a profile selling thousands of tickets, something Viagogo denies

Viagogo said it refutes this man's claims, insisting 73% of sellers on its site sold fewer than five tickets each - and other sellers included sports clubs and promoters. Now he is prime minister, the UK government has held a consultation with proposals including a price cap that ranges from the original price to 30% above face value, introducing larger fines and a new licensing regime.

Watch: Trump says the US will talk with Iran "next week"

The head of the CIA has said US strikes "severely damaged" Iran's nuclear facilities and set them back years, diverging from a leaked intelligence report that angered President Donald Trump by downplaying the raid's impact. The statement from Ratcliffe, who was appointed by Trump, said the CIA's information included "new intelligence from an historically reliable and accurate source/method that several key Iranian nuclear facilities were destroyed and would have to be rebuilt over the course of years".

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has also come out in support of Trump's assessment on the damage to Iranian nuclear facilities. But Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei told Al Jazeera on Wednesday: "Our nuclear installations have been badly damaged, that's for sure." He did not elaborate.

**Watch: John and Amy Hunt's interview with BBC's Victoria Derbyshire**
BBC racing commentator John Hunt has spoken for the first time since the murder of his wife and two daughters, in July last year.

John and his daughter Amy told the BBC the love of their family has helped to sustain them through their trauma and grief.

They say they took the decision to talk publicly now because they did not want their loved ones to be defined by their deaths. They also feel much of the initial reporting after the murders was inaccurate and it added to their pain.

Amy says they wanted to "breathe life back into my mum, Hannah and Louise as fully-rounded people."

You can watch the full interview Standing Strong: The John and Amy Hunt interview with Victoria Derbyshire at 21:00 BST on BBC1 and the iPlayer.
